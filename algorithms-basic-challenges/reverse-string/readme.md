# Reverse String

# Instructions
Write a function called reverseString that takes in a string and returns the reverse of that string. In this section, we are really focusing on loops without using any built-in methods, so try that first. If you get stuck, you can always use the built-in methods to solve the problem.

# Function Signature

/**
 * Returns the reverse of a string.
 * @param {string} str - The string to reverse.
 * @returns {string} - The reverse of the string.
 */
function reverseString(str: string): string;


# Examples

reverseString('hello') // 'olleh'
reverseString('world') // 'dlrow'
reverseString('') // ''
