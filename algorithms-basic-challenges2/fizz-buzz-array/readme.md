# FizzBuzz Array

# Instructions

Traditionally, you loop from 1 to 100 and print out each number. However, if the number is divisible by 3, you print out "Fizz" instead. If the number is divisible by 5, you print out "Buzz" instead. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print out "FizzBuzz" instead.


# Function Signature
/**
 * Returns an array of numbers from 1 to the number passed in.
 * @param {number} num - The number to loop up to.
 * @returns {any[]} - The array of numbers.
 */
function FizzBuzz(num: number): any[];

# Examples

```ts
FizzBuzz(5); // [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz"]
FizzBuzz(15); // [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz"]
