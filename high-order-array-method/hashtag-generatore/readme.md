# Hashtag Generator

## Instructions

Write a function called `HashTagGeneratore` that takes a string as input and returns a hashtag-generated string according to the rules below. If the generated hashtag string is longer than 140 characters or the input/result is an empty string, the function should return `false`.

## Function Signature


```ts
/**
 * Generates a hashtag from the input string.
 * @param {string} str - The input string.
 * @returns {string|boolean} - The generated hashtag string or false.
 */
function HashTagGeneratore(str: string): string | boolean;
```

## Examples

```ts
HashTagGeneratore("JavaScript is awesome"); // "#JavaScriptIsAwesome"
HashTagGeneratore("hello world"); // "#HelloWorld"
HashTagGeneratore("This is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long input that should result in a false hashtag because it exceeds the character limit of 140"); // false
HashTagGeneratore(""); // false
```

## Constraints

- Return `false` if the input string is empty or contains only whitespace characters.
- Return `false` if the generated hashtag string is longer than 140 characters.
