# What Are High Order Array Methods?

> Most of the challenges that we have done so far have used loops. Loops are one of the biggest fundamentals in computer science in general. It's important that you know how to use them. For the next batch of challenges, I want to utilize some of the high order array methods in JavaScript, such as map and filter. These methods are very useful and can help you write cleaner code. Using loops is usually a bit more efficient, but the difference is negligible unless you are dealing with a very very large data set. In everyday code, it's better to write clean code that is easy to read and understand.

> A high order array method is a method that takes in a function as an argument or returns a function as a result. The most common high order array methods are map, filter, and reduce. There are a few others, but these are the ones that I use the most. They allow us to iterate over an array and perform some sort of operation on each element.

# Example

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

###### Here are some other high order array methods that you might see:


> - some - returns true if at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the function
> - every - returns true if all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the function
> - find - returns the value of the first element in the array that passes the test implemented by the function
> - findIndex - returns the index of the first element in the array that passes the test implemented by the function
> - sort - sorts the elements in the array
> - reverse - reverses the order of the elements in the array
> - includes - returns true if the array contains a certain element
